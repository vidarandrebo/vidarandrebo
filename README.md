# My Setup
## Editor Font of Choice
[IBM Plex Mono](https://github.com/IBM/plex)

## Editor Configs
I usually use a version of vim or an editor with some form of vim emulation. Here are my rc files:

[Vim](.vimrc) (This one is mostly used with VS and certain Jetbrains IDEs, and therfore does not include any extensions)

[NeoVim](init.lua) I use NeoVim for programming smaller projects in C, python and for general text editing.
